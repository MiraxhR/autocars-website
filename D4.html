                    First production Audi with a Collision avoidance system: Pre sense[33] (similar to Mercedes-Benz Pre-Safe).
                     The full version of the system (Pre Sense Plus) works in four phases. In the first phase, 
                     the system provides warning of an impending accident, while the hazard warning lights are activated, 
                     the side windows and sunroof are closed and the front seat belts are tensioned. In the second phase, 
                     the warning is followed by light braking, strong enough to win the driver's attention. 
                     The third phase initiates autonomous partial braking at a rate of 3 m/s2 (9.8 ft/s2). 
                     The fourth phase decelerates the car at 5 m/s2 (16.4 ft/s2) followed by automatic deceleration at full braking power,
                      roughly half a second before projected impact. A second system, called (Pre Sense Rear), is designed to reduce the consequences of rear-end collisions.
