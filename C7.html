                The fourth generation C7 series Audi A6 (internally designated Typ 4G) was launched in early 2011 for the European market and in other markets soon after. It is heavily influenced by the Audi A8 (D4), pulling elements from its exterior details.[38][39] The A6 shares its interior, platform, and powertrain (Modular Longitudinal Platform) with the Audi A7 four door sedan, which had been released shortly before also in 2011. Compared to the A8 and A7, the A6 has the most aggressive front fascia and LED headlights (optional full LED headlamps). Design work began in 2006, with Jurgen Loffler's exterior design being chosen in 2008.[40]

                The new A6 increased its wheelbase by nearly 3 in (76 mm) and its width by 2.7 in (69 mm). The redesign also decreased the car's drag coefficient to 0.25.
                
                European engine choices for the C7 include two petrol engines – a 2.8-litre FSI V6 with 204 hp (152 kW) and a 300 hp (224 kW), 3.0-litre supercharged FSI engine – and two diesel engines – a 2.0-litre inline four-cylinder and a 3.0-litre turbocharged diesel engine in three states of tune.[41] The European A6 3.0 TFSI will have an optional seven-speed dual-clutch transmission and an air suspension option, two features that will not be available on the United States model.[42]
