                The GTI 25th Anniversary Edition was a special version of the Golf GTI for the European market to commemorate the first GTI, launched in 1976. The 25th Anniversary edition was available in three paint colour options: Tornado Red, Reflex Silver & Diamond Black.[5]

The GTI 25th anniversary edition was equipped with many extra features not included in the standard GTI, which included: 18x7.5" BBS RC wheels with a special shot peened finish, a perforated leather steering wheel, shift boot, and handbrake, red accented seat belts, red and black upholstered Recaro seats, a body kit (front valance, side skirts, hatch spoiler, and rear valance), blackened headlights, a 02M 6-speed manual transmission, larger 312mm front brakes and 256mm vented rear brakes with red painted calipers, a lowered sport tuned suspension, and brushed aluminium interior trim.

At the 2002 New York International Auto Show, VW announced the 25th Anniversary Edition would be sold in the US Market as the GTI 337 Edition, named for the early 1970s Golf/GTI codename. Available only in Reflex Silver, the 337 Edition was substantially the same as the European 25th Anniversary GTI, albeit without the black headlight trim.[6]

These models were never equipped with a sunroof as to take the car back to its roots, the Mk1 GTI, and improve handling and performance. However, one instance of the 337 edition is known to have been special ordered with a sunroof.[citation needed]

This version of the GTI was only available in a 3-door configuration and was also available with the PD150 TDI engine, running the shortest ratio EFF 02M 6 speed manual gearbox. (Standard GTI TDI models had the PD150 engine with the ERF 02M gearbox, the mid-way point for ratio length).[citation needed]

The UK versions of the Anniversary edition were numbered with individual plaques placed on the fusebox cover.
                Following the initial commemorative anniversary edition MK3 GTI produced in Europe in 1996 celebrating the introduction of the GTI model in 1976, and the overwhelming popularity of the 25th anniversary edition GTI produced 2001, Volkswagen of America produced 4,200 "20th Anniversary Edition" GTIs for 2003; 4,000 were shipped to the United States and 200 to Canada. This marked the 20th anniversary of the GTI's 1983 introduction to the U.S. and Canadian market, some seven years after the GTI was introduced to the European market. Several special features distinguish the 20th Anniversary GTI from the standard GTI, most of which were shared with the 337 Edition of 2002.
                On the outside, the 20th Anniversary edition came with throwback red-lettered GTI logos on the left front and right rear. The rear was also accompanied by a vintage-look chrome rabbit. Similar to the 25th Anniversary edition, exterior included Votex front and rear valences, side skirts, and hatch spoiler, black headlight trim, black painted wing mirrors, and 18" OZ Aristo alloy wheels wrapped in Michelin Pilot Sport tires. These models were only produced in three colors: Imola Yellow, Jazz Blue, and Black Magic Pearl. Distribution of production was 50% Black magic pearl, 25% Jazz Blue and 25% Imola Yellow.

Inside, all 20th Anniversary GTIs included a sunroof, a black headliner, and a golf ball shift knob. The steering wheel, shifter boot, and handbrake handle were trimmed in black leather with silver stitching. Unique black cloth Recaro bucket seats with silver stitching accents and red GTI embroidery were also included. Aluminum trim came standard, and included a numbered nameplate above the radio identifying the exact production number (US production only) of the vehicle.[7] Volkswagen's premium 8-speaker Monsoon stereo system was also standard.

Mechanically, the 20th Anniversary Edition GTI is nearly identical to the GTI 337 Edition. Including the 6-speed manual 02M transmission, 30 mm lowered suspension, and 1.8T engine. The brakes were also upgraded with 12.3" vented rotors up front and 10.3" vented rotors in the rear, as well as red powder-coated calipers.
