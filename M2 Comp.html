                The BMW M2 Competition was introduced at the 2018 Beijing Auto Show and replaced the standard M2 Coup√© as a more powerful variant.[12] Production began first in July 2018, delivered early 2019.[13]

                The M2 Competition uses the BMW M GmbH S55 engine, a high performance variant of the N55 engine, that has been detuned from its application in the F80 M3 and F82 M4.
                 The decision to use the S55 engine was a result of Europe adopting the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure as the official procedure to 
                 measure vehicle pollutants, which meant that the standard M2's N55 engine was no longer conformed to European emission standards.[14] 
                 Differences from the N55 engine found in the standard M2, the S55 includes a closed-deck engine block, lightweight crankshaft, different crankshaft bearings,
                  strengthened pistons/rods, different springs/valve material, twin turbos, twin fuel pumps, active exhaust, revised cooling system and intercoolers.
