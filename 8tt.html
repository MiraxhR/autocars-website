After winning the hearts of the customers in 2007 with the first generation of the A5 and after 9 years of proved success, Audi decided it was time for a new generation.

 The timeless design of the A5 along with the great luxury and the comfort features of an A4 made the A5 one of the user’s top choices.
 
 In the standard version, the A5 lacked a bluetooth audio connectivity and a USB port. Safety-wise, it did not offer as much as the competitors did, the coupe offering only a blind-spot monitor. While the competitor’s cars were more expensive than the luxurious 2-door car, they did offer more technology.
 
 Despite the downsides, the A5 was still an attractive car that came with a standard all-wheel-drive and a well designed suspension.
 
 Besides the coupe, Audi also released the convertible version of the A5, a car that was equipped with a power-operated soft top.
 
 The A5 was available with 2 trim levels: the Premium and the Premium Plus.
 
 The base level came with standard 188-inch alloys, automatic headlights, LED running lights, automatic wipers, heated mirrors, a tilt-only sunroof, leather upholstery and other great features.
 
 The Premium Plus added features such as auto-dimming mirrors, keyless entry and go and a high quality Bang & Olufsen 14-speaker audio system for the coupe.
 
 Users could add a sport package to the Premium Plus trim level and it consisted of front sport seats, a sport flat-bottomed steering wheel along with the Audi’s Drive Select system (calibrations for the steering, throttle and automatic transmission).</i>
