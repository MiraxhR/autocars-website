                Following a hiatus in M6 production for 16 years, the M6 version of the E63/E64 6 Series was introduced in 2005. The M6 uses the same BMW S85 V10 engine and SMG-III automated manual gearbox as the E60 M5.[15]

                The M6 was produced as both a coupé (E63 model code) and a convertible (E64 model code). The exterior styling was overseen by Karl Elmitt.[16]
                
                The M6 had two modes for engine power: a "P400" mode in which the engine has a rated power output of 294 kW (394 hp) and a "P500" mode in which the engine has a rated power output of 373 kW (500 hp).[17] Manufacturer claimed performance included a 0–62 mph (100 km/h) acceleration time of 4.6 seconds.[15] The top speed was electronically limited to 250 km/h (155 mph) or 305 km/h (190 mph) if the optional M-driver's package is fitted.[18][19]
                
                The coupe version weighs 1,785 kg (3,935 lb),[20] and the convertible version weighs 2,005 kg (4,420 lb).[21] Weight reduction measures include a (coupe-only) carbon fibre roof (a first for regular production model last used on E46 M3 CSL),[22] thermoplastic quarter panels, aluminium doors, aluminium bonnet (hood) and a thermo-fibre plastic boot (trunk) lid.[23]
                
                From 2007 a 6-speed manual gearbox was offered in North America, only 701 examples were produced with a manual gearbox (323 Coupes and 378 Convertibles).[24]
                
                Production of the M6 ended in 2011, with sales over the five-year run totalling 9,087 for the coupe and 5,065 for the convertible.[25]
