                    Like the GTI, the Golf R is also built as a three- or five-door hatchback. It is powered by a newly developed version of the 1,984 cc (2.0 L; 121.1 cu in) turbocharged EA888 petrol FSI inline-four engine used in the latest Golf GTI, Audi S3, Volkswagen Tiguan and Jetta, and dozens of other Volkswagen AG vehicles, but in this application producing 300 PS (221 kW; 296 hp) (or 280 PS (206 kW; 276 hp) for "hot climate" markets such as Australia, South Africa, Japan, and the US) from 5,500 to 6,200 rpm and 380 N⋅m (280 lb⋅ft) from 1,800 to 5,500 rpm of torque.[79] Compared to the GTI's powerplant, the Golf R's engine has a modified cylinder head, exhaust valves, valve seats and springs, pistons, injection valves and larger intercooler and turbocharger. DSG equipped models also come with an auxiliary oil cooler on the passenger side on right hand drive models.

                    0-62 mph (100 km/h) takes 5.1 seconds (versus 5.7 seconds for previous Golf R), or 4.9 seconds with optional DSG gearbox. The top speed is electronically limited to 155 mph (249 km/h). Despite this increased performance, a combined fuel consumption of 39.8 miles per imperial gallon (7.10 L/100 km; 33.1 mpg‑US), and CO2 emissions of 165 g/km (159 g/km DSG) make the Golf R up to 18 percent more efficient than its predecessor.
                    
                    The R uses an updated, fifth-generation Haldex 4MOTION four-wheel drive system. Under low loads or when coasting, the rear axle is decoupled, helping to reduce fuel consumption. Drive to the rear axle can be engaged in fractions of a second via the Haldex coupling, which is actuated by an electro-hydraulic pump. Up to 50 percent of power can be transferred to the rear axle. A brake actuated, XDS+ system mimics a limited-slip differential by applying the brakes to the wheel with the least traction, this is on both the front and rear axles.
                    
                    The ride height is 20 mm lower than the standard Golf. Golf R models equipped with the optional 'DCC' (Dynamic Chassis Control), offer three suspension modes: 'Comfort', 'Normal', and 'Race'. Each mode adjusts the stiffness of the suspension damping, thereby offering drivers a way to change the way the vehicle responds by the push of a button. Comfort mode places the dampers in the softest setting, increasing the absorption of road imperfections allowing for a smoother and more comfortable ride. Race mode stiffens the dampers to their most aggressive setting, reducing body movements and increasing adhesion to the road for more precise high speed driving. Race mode also increases throttle response, firms up the steering for a heftier feel, and alters the shift pattern of the DSG gearbox (where fitted) as well as increases the speed of the Adaptive headlamps (AFS) response time.
                    
                    On top of ESC Sport mode, as found on the GTI and GTD, which delays intervention of the electronic stability control system, the R offers the option fully to disengage the ESC, for track driving.
                    
                    For the Canadian market, the optional Discover Pro 8" infotainment system is available as part of the single option "Technology Package", while only the 6.5" Discover is available to US consumers. In North America The Golf R comes standard with halogen tail lights and HID Bi-Xenon Headlight with LED front and side view mirror turn signals, while ROW markets received the options for a sunroof, a three-door version, and LED tail lights. All these features are not available to the North American version. The Golf R and e-Golf are the only Golf models available in North America that was produced in Germany. Other Golf models for the North American market are produced by Volkswagen de México in Puebla, Mexico.
                    
                    A limited edition Golf R400 was rumored in August 2015 by Heinz-Jakob Neusser, then-head of brand development, but in the wake of the Volkswagen emissions scandal (and Neusser's suspension) it was cancelled in favor of focusing on the Golf R.
                    
                    For the South African market, the Golf R received another upgrade in power in March 2019. The upgrade resulted in 310 PS (228 kW; 306 hp) and 400 N⋅m (41 kg⋅m; 295 lb⋅ft) of torque (up from 290 PS (213 kW; 286 hp) and 380 N⋅m (39 kg⋅m; 280 lb⋅ft) in the facelift seen in July 2017). Additionally, the Golf R was also optionally available with an Akrapovič performance exhaust from the factory.[80]
                    
                    The Mk7 Golf R was discontinued in the United States in August 2019.
