                The successful Golf GTI (or, in the US, simply "GTI") was continued with the Mk2 as a sporty 3- or 5-door hatchback. Like late Mk1 GTIs, 
                it featured a naturally aspirated Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injected 1,781 cc (1.8 L; 108.7 cu in) Inline-four engine developing 112 PS (82.4 kW; 110.5 hp).
                 In 1986 (1987 for North America) a Golf GTI 16V was introduced; here the 1.8 litre engine output was 139 PS (137 hp; 102 kW) at 6,100 rpm (or 129 metric 
                 horsepower (95 kW) for the catalyst version) and 168 newton-metres (124 lbfâ‹…ft) at 4,600 rpm of torque,[6] the model was marked by discreet red-and-black 
                 "16V" badges front and rear. US/Canadian GTIs were later equipped with 2.0, 16-valve engines, available in the Passat and Corrado outside North America. In 1990, 
                 like the Golf, the GTI was given a facelift, and the "Big Bumper" became standard on all GTIs. This was maintained through the rest of the Mk2 model era. 
                 In 1990 the GTi G60 was also introduced featuring the 8v 1.8 with a G60 supercharger this version is not to be confused with the very rare G60 Limited (see below).

                For the South African market, Volkswagen SA added a 2.0 8v engine in January 1992, the same engine which would go on to be used in the Mk3 model launched later that year.[7]

                Golf Syncro
                In February 1986, Volkswagen presented the first Golf with four-wheel drive. This Golf Syncro was available as a five-door with the 1.8 engine only (90 PS (66 kW; 89 hp), 
                later 98 metric horsepower (72 kW; 97 hp)). Its 4WD system had been developed in collaboration with Steyr-Daimler-Puch[8] of Austria, and featured a viscous coupling and
                flexible partition of torque between front and rear axle - up to 48% to the rear. Due to its high price (in 1986, a Syncro cost about 30% more than an equivalent front wheel 
                 drive model[9]) the model remained rare; from 1986 to 1989, for instance, just 26,000[10] Syncros were built. Fewer than 1,000 were sold on the UK market.

                    The four-wheel-drive system was fully automatic and minimally intrusive, also in appearance. Aside from a few discreet "Syncro" badges there was no way to tell. There were no 
                additional gauges or buttons in the interior either. The gearing was lowered somewhat, to mask the performance losses due to the additional 160 kilograms (350 lb). 
                The rear seat was moved forward 30 mm (1.2 in), and the cargo floor was raised, making the luggage compartment 25 percent smaller than in a regular Golf.[11]
