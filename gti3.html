                Volkswagen produced a limited quantity of 1000 special-edition 3 and 5 door GTI Anniversary models, celebrating 20 years of the GTI model. 
                This had the usual GTI specification but came equipped with special checkered Recaro front sport seats and matching rear seats bearing the GTI logo,
                 red seat belts front and rear, half-chromed and leather golf ball gear knob, red stitched leather steering wheel and handbrake gaiter. 
                 The release knob on the hand brake was also red and silver instrument dials. Floor mats also had red piping along their edges. 
                 The red theme continued externally with a red striping on the bumpers and red brake calipers. The wheels were 16" x 7" split rim BBS RS 722 alloys,
                  visually similar to the 15" that were found on VR6 model. Also featured were brushed stainless-steel rear twin tailpipes on the exhaust and 
                  smoked front fog and indicator lamps to match the rear lamps. 3 optional extras were made available: electric sunroof, 
                  air conditioning and metallic black paintwork. Insurance was based on the standard GTI which made this version a very desirable model. 
                  The edition was sold in only 6 color schemes and the 1000 number figures that were produced was as follows: 600 8 valve models, 
                  150 16 valve models and 250 TDI models. The diesel model was only produced for the European market and was not sold in the UK.
                   Unfortunately, many of the models fell into the UK company car and lease market prior to the second-hand market and it believed only a few hundred still survive.
                    However, another factor in the rarity of Mark 3 Golfs, unlike the excellent build quality of the Mark 2, at least in the UK, 
                    is the very low-quality steel sourced by VW on some occasions, and used across the range, from entry model to VR6. 
                    According to independent mechanics and parts specialists, and MOT testers, the floor-pan, both door sills, 
                    and rear hatch can suffer severe rot and disintegration, and anybody planning to buy one is advised to check for rot, and holes and patches to the floor-pan.
