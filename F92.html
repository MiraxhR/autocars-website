            <p>The BMW M8 is the high performance version of the BMW 8 Series (G15) marketed under the BMW M sub-brand.

                Introduced in June 2019, the M8 was initially produced in the 2-door convertible (F91 model code) and 2-door coupe (F92 model code) body styles.[2][3] A 4-door sedan (F93 model code, marketed as 'Gran Coupe') body style was added to the lineup in October 2019.[4][5][6][7] The M8 is powered by the BMW S63 twin-turbocharged V8 engine shared with the BMW M5 (F90).
                BMW revived the 8 Series nameplate by introducing the M8 GTE racecar (a first by BMW, as the brand usually introduces the production version first), which replaced the M6 GTLM at the end of the 2017 season of the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship, leading to speculation about a production equivalent to the racing car.[8] At the 2018 Geneva Motor Show, BMW introduced the M8 Gran Coup√© Concept, which previewed a high performance four-door variant of the Concept 8 Series introduced alongside the M8 GTE at the 2017 Frankfurt Motor Show. The design of the concept was based on the M8 GTE and sported aggressive M performance visual parts.[9] Prototypes of the M8 began testing in June 2017 when another Concept of the 8 Series was unveiled to the public.[10]
