                The second generation A7 was revealed in October 2017, officially launching in Germany in February 2018, and has been on sale in Europe since late 2017.[43] It made its North American debut at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit on 12 January 2018.[44] Production started in February 2018 at Audi's Neckarsulm plant.[45]
            In April 2021, Audi launched the three-box sedan version of the A7, called the A7L.[47] It is only sold in China as the first Audi model manufactured by the SAIC Volkswagen joint venture.[48] The engine is the same as that used in the liftback version, 3.0-litre TFSI engine with 335 hp (250 kW; 340 PS) and 500 N⋅m (369 lbf⋅ft) of torque.
            At launch, the A7 was powered by a six-cylinder petrol engine making 250 kW (340 PS; 335 hp) and 500 N⋅m (369 lbf⋅ft), an engine also used in the new Audi A8. Further engines will follow soon after the start of production.[49]

            All units will receive a 48-volt vehicle electrical system, which together with the belt alternator starter (BAS) comprises the MHEV system (Mild Hybrid Electric Vehicle).[50]
