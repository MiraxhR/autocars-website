                The vehicle was unveiled at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show[36][failed verification][37] and went on sale in Europe in September 2012.

First vehicle using the flexible modular Volkswagen Group MQB platform, the third generation is available as a three-door hatchback, a five-door "Sportback", a four-door saloon to directly rival the Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class, and a two-door Cabriolet.

The front suspension is a MacPherson strut set-up while the rear utilizes torsion bar suspension (models with less than 150 PS) or multi-link rear suspension (models with 150 PS or more).
Early German models include 1.4 TFSI (122 PS), 1.8 TFSI (180 PS), and 2.0 TDI (150 PS).[40][failed verification] 1.2 TFSI (105 PS), 1.4 TFSI (140 PS), 1.8 TFSI quattro (180 PS), 1.6 TDI (105 PS), and 2.0 TDI quattro (150 PS) were added in 2013.[41][failed verification]

A3 1.2 TFSI (105 PS) was added to the UK market in 2013,[42] followed by A3 1.4 TFSI (140 PS) in 2013.[43]

For the 2020 model year, the vehicle is exclusively built at the Ingolstadt plant, as opposed to previous model years where sedans and convertibles were built at the Gy≈ër plant.
