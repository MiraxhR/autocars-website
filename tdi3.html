                The Volkswagen Golf Mk3 is a medium-sized compact family car. The third generation of the Volkswagen Golf and the successor to the Volkswagen Golf Mk2,
                 which was produced by Volkswagen from August 1991 (for the 1992 model year) to 2002 (for Cabrio convertible).

The Golf Mk3 was launched in mainland Europe in August 1991,[2] in the United Kingdom in February 1992,[3] and in North America in the spring of 1994.
 The delay in North America was due to Volkswagen's decision to supply U.S. and Canadian dealerships with Mk3 Golfs (and A3 Jettas) from the VW plant in Puebla, Mexico.
 Quality control problems led Volkswagen of America to reject Golfs and Jettas from Mexico. Thereafter, labor unrest at the plant delayed production. 
 The third-generation Golf and Jetta first launched in North America as 1993 models in the San Diego, California area and in Canada, 
 then in the autumn in the rest of North America as 1994 models.

The Mk3 Cabrio replaced the Volkswagen Cabriolet. The Mk3 Cabrio continued until the 2002 model year, when Volkswagen replaced it with a convertible version of the Volkswagen New Beetle.

Like the previous two generations, the Mk3 supposed to be built at the TAS factory in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, when the car was first released the Yugoslav War broke out,
 leading to the destruction of the factory. Due to this, TAS went bankrupt in 1995. This meant the Mk3 was the only Golf before the Mk4 not to be built in Bosnia and Herzegovina,
  although a single Mk3 managed to roll off the assembly line in Sarajevo, its fate unknown.

The Mk3 Golf was sold in Japan alongside the Polo, where both vehicles complied with the small size class regulations that encouraged sales.

The Volkswagen Golf Mk3 began to be replaced with the October 1997 (model year 1998) introduction of the Volkswagen Golf Mk4. In some markets,
 the Mk3 Golf continued to be available for model year 1998 (Americas, South Africa), and even as early model year 1999 vehicles (Canada, Mexico, US).
