                    The Volkswagen Golf (Mk7) is a small family car (C-segment) manufactured by German automobile manufacturer Volkswagen. It is the seventh generation of the Golf and the successor to the Golf Mk6. It was introduced at Berlin on 4 September 2012, before a public launch at the 2012 Paris Motor Show.[5] Sales in Europe began with the model in November 2012.[6]

Marketed in three-door and five-door hatchback, van, and estate forms, the Golf Mk7 shares the MQB platform with the third-generation Audi A3, SEAT León and Škoda Octavia.

In November 2016, Volkswagen presented a facelift of the Golf Mk7.[7] It was replaced in December 2019 by the Golf Mk8, which is built on the MQB Evo platform.[8] However, production of e-Golf and Golf Variant ended in the following year in mid-2020 for Golf Variant.
Compared with the previous generation, the Golf Mk7 has a roomier cabin with greater shoulder room for the front and rear passengers, more rear legroom, and more boot space. It is 20 mm (0.8 in) wider than the Mk6, with a 59 mm (2.3 in) longer wheelbase.

Engine options at launch include 1.2 and 1.4-litre turbocharged petrol engines, with 85 PS (63 kW; 84 hp) and 140 PS (103 kW; 138 hp) respectively, and 1.6 and 2.0-litre diesel engines, with 105 PS (77 kW; 104 hp) and 150 PS (110 kW; 148 hp) respectively.[11] The 1.6 TDI BlueMotion Concept has a theoretical combined fuel consumption of 3.2 L/100 km (88 mpg‑imp; 74 mpg‑US) and anticipated 85 g/km CO2 emissions.[12]

Available body styles are three and five-door hatchbacks (including high-performance Golf GTI and Golf R models), and a five-door estate (known as the SportWagen in the United States, first advertised in May 2015).[13] Sales of the three-door hatchback were not as strong as previous generations,[citation needed] and it was dropped with the launch of the eighth generation model in late 2019.

A van version based on the three-door Golf was sold only in Ireland to commercial customers and was cancelled as corporations opted for the bigger Volkswagen Caddy.[citation needed]

At launch in the US market, Volkswagen also offered the Golf Sport model. About 650 of these SE four-door models were built, equipped with the six-speed automatic transmission. Offered in either Pure White or Platinum Gray, the Sport model is visually enhanced with a body kit that includes a front lip spoiler, side skirts, a rear valence, a larger rear spoiler, and chrome exhaust tips.[14]

The Golf went on sale in the UK in early January and was released in Australia in April 2013.[15][16]

In Brazil, the Golf Mk7 went on sale in September 2013, only in the High-line and GTI trims,[17] along with the Comfortline trim,[18] which was made available from March 2014. All models were imported from Germany until 2015, when local assembly commenced.

At its introduction in 2013, it won the Car of the Year Japan Award, the first time it was awarded to a European product.
