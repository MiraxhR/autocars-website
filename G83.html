                The second iteration of the BMW M4 (codenamed G82) is largely based on the standard 4 Series (G22 generation), which was previewed by the BMW Concept 4. It is a high performance version of the standard G22 4 Series. Prototypes of the BMW M4 have been seen tested on the Nürburgring beside the G80 BMW M3. The first units were assembled in November 2020, with global deliveries starting in early 2021.[33]

                The more notable upgrades for the G82 M4 is a 35 kW (48 PS; 47 hp) increase over the previous M4, as well as adopting the twin-kidney grille from the 4 Series.[34]
                
                The convertible version of the new M4 was introduced in May 2021. Like the standard new-generation BMW 4 Series Convertible, the M4 Convertible (internal designation G83) has a folding soft top. It normally opens/closes in 18 seconds, at speeds up to 50 km/h (31 mph). The convertible is available as a Competition model with the M xDrive. Top speed is electronically limited to 250 km/h (155 mph), but with the optional M Driver's Package, it can increase to 280 km/h (174 mph). As for acceleration on 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph), it is 3.6 seconds.
