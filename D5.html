                    The design of the A8 and A8 L was based on the Audi Prologue concept. The new generation, code-named D5, was unveiled at the Audi Summit in Barcelona on 11 July 2017 and presented at the 2017 Frankfurt Motor Show.[121] The standard wheelbase A8 went on sale in November 2017, and the long wheelbase A8 L was launched in 2018.
                    At the launch, A8 had two engine options: one 3-litre petrol V6 (55 TFSI quattro) and 3-litre diesel V6 (50 TDI quattro). For 2019, the engine range was expanded to include the petrol and diesel V8 engines (60 TFSI quattro in 2020 and 60 TDI quattro in 2019, respectively). The plug-in hybrid version (PHEV) with 3-litre petrol V6 and electric motor (60 TFSI e quattro) was launched in 2019.[128] No hybrid system is fitted to the diesel engines. The petrol V8 engine fitted to 60 TFSI quattro and S8 TFSI quattro have 48-volt MHEV system that use the electric motor as starter and for power assistance.[129] No W12 engine has been announced yet as of January 2021.

All A8, A8 L, and S8 feature quattro all-wheel-drive system and 8-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission.
