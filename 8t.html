                When presented at the March 2007 Geneva Motor Show, the A5 marked Audi's return to the compact executive coupé market since the (B3/B4) Audi 80 based coupé model ended production in 1996. On May 10, 2006, Audi confirmed that the A5 would go into production. The B6/B7 A4 spawned a convertible variant but not a coupé. For the fourth-generation A4 (B8), Audi decided to spin off the cabriolet, along with a new coupé and 4-door fastback sedan, into a nameplate of its own as the A5.

The A5 was the first of the B8 family of vehicles to be released (the others being the A4 and the Q5 crossover SUV), all based on the Audi MLP platform (Modular Longitudinal Platform) which underpin the next generation A6 and A8.[4]

The A5 is the third coupé in Audi's line up, following the second generation TT and the R8. The A5 adopted design elements of the Nuvolari quattro concept car. The A5 debuted with the 3.2 litre FSI V6 engine delivering 195 kW (265 PS; 261 hp).
