                On 25 September 2013, BMW released the technical specifications of the M4. It is powered by the S55B30 engine, which is developed and engineered by BMW M GmbH. This 3.0-litre inline-6 engine has been built specifically for the new M4/M3, having a redline of 7,600 rpm with the rev limiter actuated at 7,300 rpm. The engine uses two mono-scroll turbochargers with a peak boost pressure of 18.1 psi (1.2 bar). The power is rated at 317 kW (431 PS; 425 hp), however this is achieved not at a specific engine speed, but is instead rated throughout the range of 5,500–7,300 rpm. The engine's torque is rated at 550 N⋅m (406 lbf⋅ft) throughout the range of 1,850–5,500. Two transmission choices are available, the 6-speed manual and the 7-speed M-DCT transmissions. The 7-speed M-DCT transmission accelerates the car from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.1 seconds) and the 6-speed manual transmission from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.3 seconds.[3] The weight of the European specification M4 equipped with a manual transmission is 1,572 kg (3,466 lb) and with the M-DCT dual-clutch transmission, the car is some 40 kg (88 lb) heavier, losing some 80 kg (176 lb) as compared to the E92 M3.[4]
                As per its E92 predecessor, the roof of the coupe model is constructed from carbon fibre (except if the optional sunroof is fitted).[5] Carbon fibre is also used for the bootlid and engine brace.[6] For the first time in a M3/M4 model, an electric power steering unit is used.[
