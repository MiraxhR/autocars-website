                The second-generation M2 (G87) was shown to the public ahead of its debut at Motorclassica in Melbourne, Australia, in October 2022.[30] The second-generation M2 wheelbase is 2.1 in (53 mm) longer and overall length is 4.1 in (100 mm) longer and is 1.3 in (33 mm) wider than the first-generation M2.[31]

                The M2 is powered by the twin-turbo 3.0-litre BMW S58 straight-six engine rated at 338 kW (453 hp) at 6,250 rpm and 550 N⋅m (406 lb⋅ft) between 2,600 and 5,950 rpm.[32][33] It remains rear-wheel drive and will be available with a 6-speed manual or with an 8-speed automatic transmission.[34] 0–100 km/h acceleration times are 4.3 seconds for manual transmission models and 4.1 seconds for automatic transmission models. Top speed is limited to 250 km/h (155 mph) but can be extended to 285 km/h (177 mph) with the optional M Driver's package. 
                Some markets will have an optional carbon package. The package will include M carbon bucket seats that are both power operated and heated as well as a carbon fiber roof and carbon fiber interior trim. A power sunroof will be standard in the US but optional in Europe. Other options include a Shadowline package, a lighting package which offers full-LED adaptive headlights and automatic high beams and driver assistant packages.[35]
