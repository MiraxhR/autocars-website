                The M2 was unveiled in Need for Speed in November 2015, before later premiering at the North American International Auto Show in January 2016.[2] Production commenced in October 2015, first delivered early 2016[3] and the M2 was only available as a rear-wheel drive coupé.[4] The M2 is powered by the turbocharged 3.0-litre N55B30T0 straight-six engine rated at 272 kW (365 hp) at 6,500 rpm and 465 N⋅m (343 lb⋅ft) between 1,450 and 4,750 rpm, while an overboost function temporarily increases torque to 500 N⋅m (369 lb⋅ft).[5] The M2 features reinforced pistons, and has lighter aluminium front and rear suspension components resulting in a 5 kg (11 lb) weight reduction.[6] The M2 is available with a 6-speed manual or with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission.[7] 0–100 km/h acceleration times are 4.5 seconds manual transmission[8] models and 4.3 seconds for models equipped with the 7-speed dual clutch transmission.[9] Top speed is limited to 250 km/h (155 mph) but can be extended to 270 km/h (168 mph) with the optional M Driver's package.[10] The M2 was used as a safety car in the 2016 MotoGP season.[11]
