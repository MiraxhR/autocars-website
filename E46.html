                The M3 version of the E46 3 Series was produced in coupé and convertible body styles. The E46 M3 is powered by the S54 straight-six engine and has a 0-100 km/h (62 mph) acceleration time of 5.1 seconds for the coupé, with either the manual or SMG-II transmission.[59][60] The skidpad cornering results are 0.89 g for the coupé and 0.81 g for the convertible.[61][62] The top speed is electronically limited to 250 km/h (155 mph).[60] The kerb weight is 1,570 kg (3,461 lb).[citation needed]

The available transmissions were a Getrag 420G 6-speed manual transmission or an SMG-II 6-speed automated manual transmission, which was based on the Getrag 420G.[63] The SMG-II used an electrohydraulically actuated clutch, and gear shifts could be selected via the shift lever or paddles mounted on the steering wheel. The SMG-II was praised for its fast shift times and racetrack performance, but some people found its shifts to be delayed and lurching in stop-start traffic.[64]

Total production of the E46 M3 was 56,133 coupés and 29,633 convertibles.[65] The cars were assembled at the BMW Regensburg factory in Germany, and production was from September 2000 until August 2006, for a total of 85,766 cars.[66]
