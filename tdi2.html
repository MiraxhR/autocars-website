            <p>The Volkswagen Golf Mk2 is a hatchback, the second generation of the Volkswagen Golf and the successor to the Volkswagen Golf Mk1.
                 It was Volkswagen's highest volume seller from 1983 and ended in (German) production in late 1992, to be replaced by the Volkswagen
                  Golf Mk3. The Mk2 was larger than the Mk1; its wheelbase grew slightly (+ 75 mm (3.0 in)), as did exterior dimensions (length + 180 mm
                   (7.1 in), width + 55 mm (2.2 in), height + 5 mm (0.2 in)). Weight was up accordingly by about 120 kg (260 lb). Exterior design, developed 
                   in-house by VW design director Sch√§fer, kept the general lines of its Giugiaro-designed predecessor, but was slightly more rounded.
                    All told, about 6.3 million[2] second-generation Golfs were built.
                    The second-generation Volkswagen Golf (also known as the Typ 19E until the 1991 model year, and Typ 1G thereafter) was launched in Europe at 
                    the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 1983, with sales beginning in its homeland and most other left-hand drive markets soon after.
                     It debuted in March 1984 on the right-hand drive British market, and it was introduced as a 1985 model in the United States.
                      It featured a larger bodyshell, and a wider range of engine options, including a GTD turbodiesel (in Euro markets, 
                      later using the 1.6 "umwelt" (ECO) diesel engine), a DOHC 1781 cc (1.8) 16-valve version of the straight-four GTI 
                      (as well as the tried and tested 1781cc (1.8) 8v GTI), the supercharged 8v "G60" with front- and four-wheel drive options,
                       and a racing homologated variant of this, the "Rallye Golf". This model was intended to be sold in the United States as well (badged as "Rallye GTI"),
                        and prototypes were made, but it did not come to be.

                    The original Golf had been one of the few front-wheel drive hatchbacks on sale when launched in 1974, but within a decade almost all mainstream manufacturers
                     had launched a Golf-like family hatchback. Ford had switched to front-wheel drive hatchback format for its MK3 Escort in 1980, soon after General 
                     Motors had adapted that concept for its latest Opel Kadett (Vauxhall Astra in Britain). Austin Rover (formerly British Leyland) did not enter the small
                      family hatchback market until the launch of its Maestro at the beginning of 1983, although it had launched its larger Maxi hatchback as long ago as 1969 
                      and in 1976 had taken the then unusual step of launching a hatchback bodystyle on a luxury car (the Rover SD1). Peugeot would not launch its first Golf-sized
                       hatchback (the 309) until late 1985, but it had taken ownership of Chrysler's European division (which it renamed Talbot) in 1978, just after the launch of
                        the Chrysler/Simca Horizon hatchback. However, the likes of Fiat, Renault and Volvo had all entered the small family hatchback market by the end of the 1970s.
                         The hatchback bodystyle had also become popular on cars produced outside Europe, particularly on Japanese models.

                    In 1985, British motoring magazine What Car? awarded the Golf Mk2 1985 "Car of the Year", even though it had actually been launched on the UK market early in the 
                    previous year. It sold well in Britain, peaking at more than 50,000 sales a year by the end of the decade.

                    However, the Golf was overshadowed in the 1984 European Car of the Year contest, finishing third but being heavily outscored by the victorious Fiat Uno and runner-up 
                    Peugeot 205, which were similar in size to Volkswagen's smaller Polo.[3]
                    During the life of the Golf MK2, there were a number of external style revisions. Notable changes to the looks of the Golf MK2 included the removal of quarterlight
                     windows in the front doors, and the introduction of larger grille slats with the August 1987 facelift. The most notable was the introduction of so-called "Big Bumpers",
                      which were introduced in the European market with an August 1989 facelift. They were available in the United States from August 1989 as well, as part of the "
                      Wolfsburg Edition" package. They were not standardized until January 1990.

                    This Golf was marketed for the first time with that name in the United States and Canada. The Rabbit name used on the Mk1 was meant to give a car a cuddly image, 
                    but with the 1980s redesign of the car, Carl Hahn, the former Volkswagen of America president who was now chairman of the whole company, dictated that Volkswagen
                     model names be standardized globally. James Fuller, head of the Volkswagen brand in North America, concurred in using the Golf name to stress the car's Teutonic character.
                      The GTI body kit became available on a non-injection Golf and was sold as the "Driver" trim level in Europe. While the GTI remained a trim level in the Golf lineup in 
                      Europe, in some markets, it was (and continues to be) marketed as a separate model line.

                    The MK2 Golf remained in production until the launch of the MK3 model in August 1991. Continental sales began that autumn, but the MK3 did not take over from the MK2 on the
                     right-hand drive British market until February 1992.[4]
