                The Golf Mk7 GTI is powered by a 2.0-litre turbocharged direct-injection petrol engine (TSI) with 220 PS (162 kW; 217 hp). In the GTI Performance version, the engine's maximum power is boosted to 230 PS (169 kW; 227 hp). Both GTI models develop 350 N⋅m (36 kg⋅m; 258 lb⋅ft) of torque. The standard GTI accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in 6.5 seconds and can reach a top speed of 250 km/h. The GTI Performance has a top speed of 250 km/h and accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in 6.4 seconds.

Both versions of the GTI are equipped with a start-stop system and fulfil 2014 Euro 6 emissions standards. With a six-speed manual gearbox, they attain the same low fuel consumption value of 47.1 mpg‑imp (6.00 L/100 km) (CO2 emissions of 139 g/km). This means that the latest Golf GTI offers an 18 per cent improvement in fuel economy compared to the previous model. With the optional six-speed DSG gearbox, the two GTI models achieve fuel consumption figures of 44.1 mpg‑imp (6.41 L/100 km) (equivalent to 148 g/km CO2 for the standard GTI and 149 g/km CO2 for the GTI Performance).

Buyers who purchase the £980 Performance pack not only gain 7 kW, but also gain upgraded brakes and a limited-slip differential. The front differential is a new development, dubbed VAQ. This provides more neutral and agile driving behaviour and allows higher speeds to be carried through curves. The system consists of a multi-plate coupler between the differential cage and right driveshaft, which controls locking torque electro-hydraulically. Visually, vehicles with the Performance Pack are distinguished by 'GTI' lettering on the front brake caliper, larger vented brake discs front and rear (the same as fitted to the 'R' version), and red GTI badges on the front and rear although some cars still retained their silver badging despite being fitted with the Performance Pack.

As well as high performance, a high level of safety equipment comes as standard in the Golf GTI. On top of high passive safety levels—thanks in part to a passenger cell made from high- and ultra-high strength steels—active safety features include the Automatic Post-Collision Braking system, which automatically applies the vehicle brakes after an accident to reduce the chances of a second impact; the pre-crash system, which tensions seatbelts and closes windows and the sunroof if an accident is likely to improve the effectiveness of the airbags; and seven airbags as standard, including one for the driver's knees.

In many markets including Mexico and South Africa, the GTI version is only available with the five-door body style, with no plans to introduce the three-door body.

Volkswagen introduced a "Rabbit Edition" GTI for the 2019 model year. The Rabbit Edition featured a LED lighting package, "Vmax" spoiler, 18-inch "Pretoria" alloy wheels painted in gloss black, and red tags embroidered with the VW Rabbit logo on the seat.[69]

Volkswagen's Mexican division introduced an "Oettinger" version for the GTI for the 2021 model year. The Oettinger version features an aerodynamic kit for the front fascia with lip and splitters, side skirts, a new rear bumper with integrated diffuser and a new spoiler with flaps, which stand out next to the version-specific 18-inch wheel set and black side mirrors. It is available in three colour options; Pure White, Tornado Red and Cornflower Blue. It will go on sale on 7 December 2020 and 700 units will only be built.
Volkswagen introduced the special-edition GTI Clubsport for 2016, coinciding with the GTI's 40th anniversary.[71] The Clubsport was not available in the United States. On the exterior, the Clubsport features a revised front fascia, more aggressive rear hatch spoiler, new rear diffuser with larger exhaust tips, and a black stripe along the lower sides of the body. Inside the car, the Clubsport is equipped with bucket seats and an Alcantara steering wheel and shift lever.[72]

The Clubsport uses the same 2.0-litre EA888 turbocharged inline-4 as the standard GTI which has been revised to produce 261 horsepower,[72] with up to 286 horsepower for 10 seconds at a time via an included overboost feature which raises the engine's boost pressure by 0.2 bar, up to 2.1 bar.[71][73] Transmission choices remain the same as the standard GTI, with both the 6-speed manual and 6-speed DSG available, both equipped with the standard GTI's optional limited-slip differential. Weight is listed as 1,375 kg.[73] The Clubsport was available from the factory with optional Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires.[74] The official 0-to-60 time is quoted as 5.9 seconds, 0.6 seconds quicker than the standard GTI with Performance Package.[74]
