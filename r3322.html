                <i>In September 2005, the Mk5 R32 went on sale in Europe. United Kingdom sales began in November that year.[26] It features an updated 3.2-litre VR6 engine of that fitted to the previous Mk4 version, with an extra 10 PS (7 kW; 10 bhp) due to a reworked inlet manifold. Maximum power is now 250 PS (184 kW; 247 bhp) at 6,300 rpm; torque is unchanged at 320 N⋅m (236 lbf⋅ft). It reaches an electronically governed top speed of 250 km/h (155.3 mph). Going from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) will take 6.5 s, reduced to 6.2 s with the Direct-Shift Gearbox.

Compared with the previous Mk4 R32, it is 0.1 seconds faster for the manual version, while the newer R32 is about 40 kg (88.2 lb) heavier. As with the previous R32; there is the Haldex Traction-based 4motion part-time four-wheel drive, now through 18" Zolder 20-spoke alloy wheels. Stopping the R32 comes in the form of blue-painted brake calipers with 345 mm (13.58 in) discs at the front and 310 mm (12.20 in) disks at the rear.

The Mk5 R32 was released in the US in August 2007 with a limited production run of 5000. Each R32 has its production number laser etched on its steering wheel.

In Chile, the Golf Mk5 was only offered in this model, while the standard Golf model offered was the Brazilian-made Mk4.
Here comes that sound again. A low, chesty V6 thrum, building to a frantic yowl at high revs that threatens to knock the birds from the trees and scare the wild boar clean out of the forest. It’s part race car, part supercar, part Tyrannosaurus rex in origin, and most definitely not the sort of racket you’d expect from a Volkswagen.

But then this is a new-era Volkswagen that we’re dealing with here, the vivid blue flagship for a louder, flashier, more belligerent corporate approach. This second-generation Golf R32 joins the freshly launched BMW 130i (and, by way of strict definition, the Porsche Cayman S and Aston Martin V8 Vantage) as a contender for the title of the hottest hatch-backed car on sale today.</i>
