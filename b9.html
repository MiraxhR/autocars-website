                The fifth-generation of the A4 was revealed in June 2015 when pre-production versions were released to the motoring press, with the official launch occurring at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 2015.[58] This generation of the A4 is the fifth to carry the A4 badge and is commonly referred to as the B9, representing the ninth generation of the Audi 80/A4 series, which were originally (but no longer) based on the B platform. The B9 is slightly larger than the outgoing B8, but Audi claims the new A4 is around 120 kg (265 lb) lighter than its predecessor.
                For the first time in the history of the A4, the notchback sedan and estate variant (Avant) appeared at the same time. Audi delivered the first vehicles in October 2015.[4]

                The B9 is based on the further developed modular longitudinal matrix (MLB platform) “MLB Evo”[5] from the Volkswagen Group, on which the second generation of the Audi Q7, which was released in June 2015, is also based.
                
                The B9 series is manufactured at two production sites. While the sedan, Avant and S models roll off the assembly line at the Audi plant in Ingolstadt, only the sedan is built in Neckarsulm. In the VIN, the Audi A4 B9 has the series code F4.The body of the fifth A4 generation received a lower and wider single-frame radiator grille in the front bumper area. The sideline begins with the hood, which extends to the outer edge of the fenders. From the side, the B9 is similar to its predecessor, except for the exterior mirrors mounted on the door shoulder. The rear ends with narrow taillights, with separate reflectors mounted in the lower outer area of the rear bumper.
