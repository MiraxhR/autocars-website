                The M3 model of the E36 3 Series was released in November 1992 and was initially available as a coupé only, with a convertible version added in 1994. A saloon version was also added in December 1994, to fill in the gap caused by the lack of the M5 saloon model between the end of E34 M5 production in 1995 and the launch of the E39 M5 in 1998.[citation needed]

                In September 1995, a facelift version of the coupé was introduced. Changes included the engine displacement increasing to 3.2 L (195 cu in), the manual transmission upgrading from a 5-speed to a 6-speed,[23] different wheels and clear indicator lenses. The facelift changes were applied to the saloon model in November 1995 and the convertible model in February 1996.[24] The kerb weight of the 1996 M3 coupe in European specification is 1,515 kg (3,340 lb).[25]
                
                The facelift also saw the introduction of a 6-speed "SMG" automated manual transmission,[26] the first time an automated transmission was available on an M3 outside the United States. The SMG transmission was praised for its fast shift times and operation in performance situations, but criticized for behavior in everyday driving situations.[27]
