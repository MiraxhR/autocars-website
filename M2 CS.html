                The BMW M2 CS, a more track focused version of the BMW M2 Competition, and was unveiled online in November 2019 prior to its introduction at the LA Auto Show. Production began in March 2020, with 2,200 units planned for North America, Europe, Asia and Mexico.[22][23]

                The M2 CS uses the same engine as the M2 Competition but it uses the factory ECU management as the F82 M4 Competition package, resulting in a more powerful version of the S55 which is rated at 331 kW (444 hp) and 550 N⋅m (406 lb⋅ft) of torque (same torque as the other M models equipped with the S55 engine) .[24] The 0–100 km/h (62 mph) acceleration time is 4.2 seconds for 6-speed manual transmission models, and 4.0 seconds for models with the 7-speed dual clutch transmission.
                
                The M Performance Brakes option rotors and calipers from the M2 Competition are carried over as standard, but ceramic brakes are available as an option.[25] An adaptive M suspension is standard along with an electronic locking differential. The wheel hubs and control arms are made from forged aluminium, with a carbon-fibre transmission tunnel as an additional weight-saving measure. The hood, roof and various aerodynamic parts are made of a carbon-fibre composite. The active exhaust system is new as well, and unique wheel designs in high-gloss Jet black or matte gold finishes differentiate it from other M2 models; Michelin Cup 2 tires are also available.            </p>
