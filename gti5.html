               <i>The Golf GTI features a 2.0 litre turbocharged inline 4-cylinder petrol engine with Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) direct-injection technology, which produces 200PS (147 kW/197 bhp). It is available in both 3-door and 5-door hatchback body shapes, and comes with a choice of either 6-speed manual or a 6-speed Direct-Shift Gearbox (DSG) which greatly reduces shift time to only 8ms.[24]

Some Mk 5 GTIs bound for the North American Market produced in late 2008 and early 2009 came with a different engine. The FSI EA113 engines used in the earlier years were traded for a new design in late 2008 as VW Audi Group began producing new engines for the upcoming Mk 6 GTI (among other models) which was released for sale in late 2009. Some of the Mk 5s exported to North America in these years received this new engine and were delivered to customers with the redesigned EA888 TSI engine. This early version of the EA888 engine produced very similar horsepower and torque numbers compared to the EA113.

The main design changes came in the form of addressing known issues with the previous platform. A new high pressure fuel pump cam follower design that did not require periodic replacement due to wear was chief among them. Failure of this component in the EA113 design had the potential to lead to catastrophic engine failure if not replaced often enough. Further, the timing belt was replaced with a timing chain. This was done to address the reported problems with failed timing belts and tensioner assemblies that caused severe damage when not maintained properly in this interference engine design. One other notable change was the air intake and intake manifold design. The air intake was no longer integrated into the plastic engine cover and instead was routed around the right hand side near the battery. This design provided slightly reduced intake restriction and access to cooler air further from the engine.

The concept GTI was first shown to the public at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 2003. The first production model was initially unveiled at the Mondial de l'Automobile in Paris in September 2004, and went on sale around the world shortly thereafter. At the Los Angeles Auto Show in January 2006, the GTI made its long-awaited North American debut in 3-door guise (a 5-door variant was eventually made available), where it is marketed solely under the 'GTI' moniker, with no reference to the Rabbit. The new GTI has a considerable price increase over the previous model, mainly due to the features mentioned above, and the fact that the exterior itself had not seen such a dramatic design change in years. The price is further raised because it is built in Germany, unlike the Mk4 some of which were built in Brazil. The innovative DSG transmission and the 200 PS (147 kW; 197 hp) TFSI engine all helped raise the retail price of the car. The Mk5 GTI was named 2007 Automobile of the Year by Automobile Magazine, in December 2006.[25]

This generation marked the only generation in Canada to have the GTI as a separate nameplate rather than a trim of the Golf. When Volkswagen announced the revival of the Golf in the US and Canada for the 2010 model year, Volkswagen reverted the GTI nameplate as a Golf trim, although the GTI remains a separate nameplate in the United States.

In Mexico, it is only sold as a 3-door hatchback. A special edition of the GTI was sold in 170 copies under a "Pirelli" limited edition with a 230 CV engine and only in a black colour.</i>
