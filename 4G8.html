                The A7 is in essence, a four-door fastback version of the C7-series Audi A6, based on the Volkswagen Group MLB platform. The A7 was released before the more conventional A6 saloon/estate.[7] Both cars share the same core structure, drivetrain, chassis, dashboard and interior, whilst the A7 has its own unique exterior panelwork. It also differs from the A6 in that it uses aluminium for much of its front body structure. The A7 was also the first fastback to appear within the Audi C-platform series since the Avant version of the C2 Audi 100, which was discontinued in 1982.

                The vehicle was unveiled in Pinakothek der Moderne art museum in Munich on 26 July 2010,[8] and later at the 2010 Paris Motor Show, 2011 New York Auto Show,[9] WÃ¶rthersee Tour 2011 (in Misano Red).[10]
                
                The vehicles went on sale in autumn 2010. Early models include 2.8 FSI (204 PS (150 kW; 201 hp)) with multitronic, 3.0 TFSI quattro (300 PS (221 kW; 296 hp)) with seven-speed S tronic, 3.0 TDI quattro (245 PS (180 kW; 242 hp)) with seven-speed S tronic; followed by 3.0 TDI (204 PS (150 kW; 201 hp)) with multitronic.
