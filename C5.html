                In February 1997, the introduction of a new A6 (Typ 4B), based on a new design automobile platform – the Volkswagen Group C5 platform, with a new range of engines was announced and appeared in March at the 1997 Geneva Motor Show. This A6 was marketed in the same categories as the BMW 5 Series and the Mercedes-Benz E-Class. The redesigned body had a coefficient of drag of 0.28.[11]

                In 2000 and 2001, the "C5" A6 was on Car and Driver magazine's Ten Best list. This A6 was available with a 30-valve 2.4- and 2.8-litre V6 engines, with a numerous other engine configurations available globally. As an alternative to the manual transmission, a five-speed tiptronic automatic transmission was also available.
                
                The C5 saloon variant arrived in mid-1997 in Europe, late 1997 in North America and Australia, and the Avant in 1998.[12] In Canada, there was no Avant (Audi's name for an estate/wagon) available at all in 1998 – Audi dropped the C4 Avant at the end of the 1997 model year, and jumped straight to the C5 Avant in 1998 in conjunction with its release in the US. As a result of complying with FMVSS, the North American models were equipped with front and rear bumpers that protruded several inches further than their European counterparts, with modified brackets and bumper suspension assemblies as result, and child-seat tethers for occupant safety. In compliance with Canadian law, Canadian models received daytime running lights as standard equipment.
