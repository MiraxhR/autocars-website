                The all-new A5 and S5 Coupé, based on the ninth generation of the Volkswagen Group MLB Platform, were unveiled in June 2016. Two petrol and two diesel engines are offered for the A5. The petrol engines are 2.0 litre TFSI with either 140 kW (190 PS; 188 hp) or 185 kW (252 PS; 248 hp), and the diesel motors are 2.0 TDI and 3.0 TDI, with 140 kW (190 PS; 188 hp) or 210 kW (286 PS; 282 hp). All the 2.0-liter powerplants can be paired with a 6-speed manual gearbox (in certain countries only), or a 7/8-speed S Tronic/Tiptronic, which is standard on the 3.0 TDI. Audi's latest coupé features the Virtual Cockpit instrument panel, an edge-to-edge display behind the steering wheel inspired by the airplane cockpit. The factory option for the A5 is the S line package which consists of a sportier front bumper with an aluminum line, diffuser on the rear bumper, and S line badges on the front fenders and side panel.

The Audi A5 and the S5 Sportback were unveiled in September 2016. They are powered by the same engines as the A5 and S5 Coupé respectively.
