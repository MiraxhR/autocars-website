                The M6 lineage began in 1983 with the M635CSi model of the E24 6 Series range, which was powered by the M88/3 DOHC straight-six engine (which was a modified version of the engine used in the BMW M1 supercar). In most countries, the model was badged the M635CSi, however the equivalent model in North America and Japan was simply badged in "M6".[3]
                The European-specification M635CSi used the M88/3 engine (without a catalytic converter), which generated 210 kW (286 PS; 282 hp) at 6,500 rpm and 340 N⋅m (251 lb⋅ft) at 4,500 rpm.[4] The M6 version, sold in North America and Japan, used the S38B35 engine (with catalytic converter), which generated 256 hp (191 kW; 260 PS) and 330 N⋅m (243 lb⋅ft) at the same engine speeds.[5] The catalyzed engine was also used in European and other market cars beginning in the summer of 1987, with identical specifications to the federalized engine.[6] The sole transmission for all models was a 5-speed Getrag 280 manual transmission.[7][8]
                Other changes included BBS RS wheels, a rear lip spoiler, a larger front air dam, larger front brakes and revised suspension with a 10 mm (0.4 in) lower ride height.[9]

The E24 series became a "world car" for the 1988 and 1989 model years, sporting the same bumpers and aerodynamic treatments as its high-performance counterparts across all markets.
